First, is the Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation (SJJIF), a (nonprofit) organization with federations and tournaments all around the globe. Second, is the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation, an organization that hosts a number of major tournaments in throughout the globe. These include the Pan American Championship, European Championship, and the Mundials. California, New York and Texas are the three more popular states where you can compete frequently in tournaments within the USA. Other promotions within North America, such as American Grappling Federation (AGF), North American BJJ Federation (NABJJF), and North American Grappling Association (NAGA) host tournaments nationwide, but visit these states multiple times within a tournament season.</h2>
